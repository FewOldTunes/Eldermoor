	name = "Veneration"
	desc = "Faith in the Eleven Saints, once mortal but raised to near-godhood under the divine will of Psydon, who reigns above them all. All who venerate the saints honor Psydon, but they pray to their patron as an intercessor, a bridge between mortals and the divine. Veneration involves prayer to the saints in hopes of their favor and guidance. Most adopt a primary patron based on their vocation or calling in life, seeking their saints path to The One and All."
