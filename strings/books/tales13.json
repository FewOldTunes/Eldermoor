{"Contents":["<p><strong>The Tale of Ardent Vale</strong><br>Author: Paquetto the Scholar</p>
<p>In the age when the saints still walked among men, before the cities of Valoria rose to their great heights, there was a land where the wilds held dominion, and only the strong dared carve their name upon its soil. It was in this time that a warrior named Ardent Vale was born—a man whose deeds would be spoken of long after his body returned to dust.</p>

<p>Ardent was no noble son, nor was he chosen by divine hand. He was a hunter, raised in the thick woods that bordered the lands of men and beasts. His people knew hunger, for the forests grew wild, and the rivers ran treacherous. The elders of his village told of a curse—that deep within the thickets lay the Hollow Maw, an ancient terror that fed upon the spirit of the land itself. No hunter who entered its domain ever returned.</p>

<p>One winter, the famine struck worse than ever before, and the people of the village despaired. In their suffering, they called out to the saints, but none answered. It was then that Ardent, refusing to let his kin perish, took up his spear and declared that if the saints would not send their aid, then he would go and face the Hollow Maw himself.</p>

<p>With nothing but the stars to guide him, Ardent ventured into the cursed wood. The air grew thick, the trees whispering secrets of those who had entered before him. The deeper he went, the heavier his limbs became, as if unseen hands sought to pull him into the roots below. Yet Ardent did not waver, for he carried not just his own fate, but that of his people.</p>

<p>At last, he reached the heart of the Hollow Maw—a clearing where no light touched, and the air grew still as death. From the darkness, it emerged, a creature unlike any beast of the mortal world. Its body was the absence of form, its breath a wailing hunger. It spoke, not in words, but in sorrow, whispering of the countless lives it had taken, and how it would take his next.</p>

<p>But Ardent did not fear death. He did not offer prayer, nor did he flee. He only raised his spear and made a promise—to carve his name upon this cursed land so that no child would ever fear its hunger again.</p>

<p>The battle raged, his weapon striking the shifting void, his flesh torn but his will unbroken. The Maw lashed and howled, for no man had ever defied it so. Ardent fought not with the strength of the saints, but with the resolve of a man unwilling to let his people suffer. And in his final strike, he drove his spear into the very heart of the beast, pinning it to the earth where it would be bound for eternity.</p>

<p>The woods fell silent. The sky, once veiled, opened to reveal the stars above. And with his final breath, Ardent spoke the words that would echo through history—"Let this land be free." His body turned to dust, his spirit carried upon the wind, but the land he died for was saved. The forests grew rich once more, the rivers ran pure, and never again did the Hollow Maw rise.</p>

<p>And so, when the people of Valoria tell their tales, when the hunters of the wilds whisper their prayers, they do not call upon the saints alone. They speak of Ardent Vale, the hero who was not chosen, the warrior who was not blessed, but who gave his life so that others might live.</p>
